## What is this?

Small C program that Calculates Mortgage Payments

This Program will do a mortgage payment calculation passed to the program through the command line.

Options:
Usage: mortgagepmt [-s] -r rate [-d downpayment] price 

-s is optional and means that the mortgage will be a 15 year mortgage instead of the standard 30 year mortgage you would use as a default.

-r is required and the argument is the yearly interest rate for the loan. The interest rate should be between 3% and 10%.

-d is optional and the argument is the downpayment that will be made on the loan. It cannot be larger than the price of the home.
